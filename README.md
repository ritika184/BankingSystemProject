Internship Project | Domain: SQL | Duration: 02 June 2025 – 03 August 2025
Submitted By: Ritika Kumari | Roll Number: 2241011228
Organization: Celebal Technologies
Mentors: Anurag Yadav, Shubham Jaunjal

Project Overview

The Banking System SQL Project is a database management system that simulates core banking operations. It enables management of customer accounts, processing transactions, generating reports, and maintaining data integrity using SQL Server. The project provides hands-on experience with relational databases, stored procedures, triggers, views, and database security.

Features

Customer account management (Create, Update, Delete)

Transaction processing (Deposit, Withdrawal, Transfer)

Account statements and report generation

Stored procedures for repetitive tasks

Views for simplified data retrieval

Triggers to maintain data integrity

Backup and maintenance for data safety

Database Design

Tables: Customer, Account, Transaction, Employee, Loan, etc.

Relationships:

One-to-many: Customer → Account

One-to-many: Account → Transaction

Constraints: Primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and default values ensure data accuracy.

SQL Implementation

Stored Procedures: Automate deposits, withdrawals, fund transfers, and reports

Views: Simplify queries and provide summarized account/transaction data

Triggers: Log transactions automatically and prevent invalid operations

Functions: Custom functions for balance calculations and account verification

User Instructions
